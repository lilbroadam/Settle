# What is Settle? 🤔

Group can't decide what restaurant to eat at? Partner can't agree on a movie to watch? What you're experiencing may be known as "indecisiveness". Symptoms may include minor feelings of frustration, annoyance, or being stuck. Luckily for you, computer scientists have beat doctors to the cure this time around.
